# Anti-Gravity Voice Reader (Native Flutter)

A minimalist, high-performance voice reader app built with Flutter.
Reads PDF, Excel (.xlsx), and Text (.txt) files aloud using native Text-to-Speech (TTS).

## Features
- **Native Performance**: Built with Dart/Flutter for instant startup and smooth UI.
- **Multilingual TTS**: Supports Japanese (and system languages) with customizable speed/pitch.
- **File Parsing**: Extracts text from PDFs and Excel sheets automatically.
- **Smart Chunking**: Handles long documents by splitting text to avoid system TTS limits.
- **History & Editing**: Auto-saves reading history, with editable text area for corrections.

## Latest Version
- **v2.0.7**: Added copy/paste support, clear button, and fix for PDF text corruption (mojibake) via editing.
